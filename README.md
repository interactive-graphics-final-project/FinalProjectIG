## Introduction
“The war of the meteorites” is a game set in the Star Wars universe, in which the player impersonates a pilot struggling to survive a wave of asteroids flying on a spaceship through empty space.
The player controls the spaceship with the mouse and can left click to shoot and destroy incoming meteorites to avoid taking damage. If the player survives the wave of meteorites, a new threat is presented: an enemy spacecraft will appear on the screen attacking the player with lasers and the objective becomes to destroy the enemy.
The game was built using the ThreeJS library.


“The War of the Meteorites” uses many different elements to realise a simple game that includes all the requirements of the assignment and more.
We tried to achieve the best possible result by combining the techniques learned during the course while also managing the limited resources available in a web environment.
The mechanics of the game are compelling enough to create an enjoyable experience overall, and building it provided us with precious insight to deal with interactive graphics projects for the future.
